1. src/
   Purpose: This directory contains all your Java source code.

Files:

Java classes (.java files) for models, controllers, services, and utilities.
Interrelations:

models/: Represents the data in your application (e.g., User.java, Profile.java).
controllers/: Handles incoming HTTP requests and interacts with services to return the appropriate response (e.g., UserController.java).
services/: Contains business logic and interacts with the models and database (e.g., UserService.java).
utils/: Utility classes that provide common functionality across the application (e.g., DatabaseConnection.java).
Example Flow: A request for user data goes from UserController.java -> UserService.java -> User.java (model).

2. webapp/
   Purpose: This is where your front-end (client-side) files are located.

Files:

WEB-INF/: Configuration files like web.xml (for servlet configuration).
css/: Stylesheets (.css files) for styling your HTML pages, including Tailwind CSS files.
js/: JavaScript files (.js), which add interactivity to your pages.
images/: Image files used in the site (e.g., .jpg, .png).
pages/: HTML files (.html) representing different pages of your site.
Interrelations:

HTML files in pages/ reference CSS files from css/ and JavaScript files from js/.
The WEB-INF/ folder ensures that certain resources are hidden from direct access via the browser (e.g., servlet configurations).
Example Flow: A user visits index.html (located in pages/). This file uses styles from styles.css (located in css/) and scripts from main.js (located in js/).

3. lib/
   Purpose: Holds external libraries that your application depends on.
   Files:
   JAR files (.jar), such as JDBC drivers or other third-party libraries.
   Interrelations:
   Java code in src/ may rely on these external libraries for database connectivity, JSON parsing, etc.
   Example: If you use MySQL, the MySQL Connector JAR would be placed here.
4. config/
   Purpose: Contains configuration files specific to your application.
   Files:
   Properties files (.properties), XML files (.xml), or other configuration formats.
   Interrelations:
   Java classes (especially in utils/) may load configuration settings from these files.
   Example: A database.properties file here might store your database connection details.
5. sql/
   Purpose: Stores SQL scripts for creating and populating your database.
   Files:
   SQL files (.sql) containing CREATE TABLE, INSERT, or other SQL commands.
   Interrelations:
   These scripts are run during the initial setup or updates of your database.
   Example: create_tables.sql may be used to create the users table.
6. logs/
   Purpose: Stores log files generated by your application.
   Files:
   Log files (.log), which contain runtime information for debugging and monitoring.
   Interrelations:
   Java classes, especially in services/ and controllers/, may write logs here.
   Example: application.log might store information about user login attempts.
7. build/
   Purpose: Holds compiled Java classes and other build artifacts.
   Files:
   Compiled Java classes (.class files) and possibly a JAR file of your project.
   Interrelations:
   The result of compiling your Java source code (src/) using a build tool or IDE.
   Example: After building the project, UserController.class might reside here.
8. tests/
   Purpose: Contains test cases for your application.
   Files:
   Java test classes (.java files) often using testing frameworks like JUnit.
   Interrelations:
   Tests interact with the code in src/ to verify its correctness.
   Example: UserServiceTest.java might test the methods in UserService.java.
9. README.md
   Purpose: A markdown file that documents your project.
   Files:
   A single markdown file (README.md).
   Interrelations:
   Provides information about the project, setup instructions, and usage.
   Example: Instructions on how to run the project and what each part does.
10. pom.xml/build.xml
    Purpose: If you use a build tool, these files define your build configuration.
    Files:
    pom.xml for Maven or build.xml for Ant.
    Interrelations:
    Defines dependencies, build steps, and other settings for compiling and packaging your project.
    Example: Specifies that MySQL Connector should be downloaded and included in the lib/ directory.
    How They Work Together:
    Development Phase:

You write Java code in src/ and front-end code in webapp/.
External libraries in lib/ are referenced by your Java code.
Configuration settings are loaded from config/.
SQL scripts in sql/ set up your MySQL database.
Build Phase:

Your Java code in src/ is compiled into .class files in build/.
Tests in tests/ ensure the code works as expected.
Deployment and Runtime:

Your application is deployed, and the front-end files from webapp/ are served to users.
Java classes interact with the database, using configurations from config/.
Logs are generated and saved in logs/.
Documentation:

The README.md file provides instructions and documentation for anyone using or contributing to the project.
